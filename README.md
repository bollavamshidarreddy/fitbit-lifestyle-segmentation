#  Advanced User Lifestyle Segmentation Using Fitbit Activity & Sleep Data

> **SQL-First Behavioral Analytics | Multi-Granularity EDA | Lifestyle Segmentation**

##  Project Overview
Wearable devices like **Fitbit** continuously capture rich behavioral data describing how users move, rest, and expend energy.  
This project builds a **strict SQL-driven analytics pipeline** to segment users into meaningful **lifestyle groups**, enabling **personalized wellness insights** for **Bellabeat**.

Unlike typical notebook-based analysis, this project enforces **database-level rigor**, mirroring real-world analytics and BI workflows.

##  Business Objective
Bellabeat aims to transition from generic wellness recommendations to **behavior-aware, personalized engagement** by understanding:
- How consistently users behave
- When users are active or inactive (circadian rhythm)
- How efficiently users convert activity into energy expenditure
- How activity impacts recovery and sleep
